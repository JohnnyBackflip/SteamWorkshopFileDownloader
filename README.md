# SteamWorkshopFileDownloader
Steam workshop file downloader

This is a simple script that downloads images, pdfs and text files from Steam Workshop .json files. It scans the .json for http(s) links and downloads everything it finds in that file.

# How to run
You need NodeJs to be installed. I'm running the script with NodeJs v12.16.1.

## Install
1) Clone the repo
2) run "npm install"

## Start the script
1) run "npm start"

## Things to remember
At the current state it assumes that the downloaded text files are .obj files.
